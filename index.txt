Join Us for High Tea and Toddies in the Card Room

Dear %%first_name%%,

Let’s mix and mingle with tea and toddies and discuss the impact of the new Alabama Literacy Act on professional development for your preK–3 teachers and how our LETRS® (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) course of study gives them the deep foundation necessary to teach language and literacy skills to every student.
